=== RGB24 -> Grayscale (#1000 times, 720p) ===
CompV: 169.ms(st), 54.ms(mt)
OpenCV: 341.ms

=== FAST9_16, Nonmax (#1000 times, 720p) ===
CompV: 1869.ms(st,sse2), 846.ms(mt,sse2)
OpenCV: 1891.ms
Remarque: The way we write to the shared strengths buffer is slow but required to have best support for multithreading.
This is why we are better than OpenCV by faaaaar.
